1. Started with setting up the website, I followed this tutorial to publish. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTqqvaVKAJU&t=113s
2. I used the last website we made in class as a reference for how to set up the site.
3. The template wasn't appearing on the site because I had everything dragged into another folder.
4. Edited the title and subtitle by replacing the text.
5. Deleted the template to restart
6. Used the beginning of the band website, changed the header.
7. Changed the font to verdana
8. Created a section with this:
```</h1>
<p>
  <h2>The Board</h2>```

9. Changed the colors in the css file
10. Added 'The Board' header and text, also I realized that the formatting was incorrect because I used h2 instead of h1, and the font section was placed in the wrong section in the styles.css section.
11. Changed `background-color: rgb#4a6cea;` to `background-color: #4a6cea;` this this is a hex code, forgot to remove it the first time and the background colors defaulted to the text color.
12. Edited the body text, changed the formatting for h2.
13. Uploaded the images for 'The Board' section
14. Removed the extra 'h1'
