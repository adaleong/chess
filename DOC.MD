1. Started with setting up the website, I followed this tutorial to publish. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTqqvaVKAJU&t=113s
2. I used the last website we made in class as a reference for how to set up the site.
3. The template wasn't appearing on the site because I had everything dragged into another folder.
4. Edited the title and subtitle by replacing the text.
