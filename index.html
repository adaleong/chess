<h1>
LET'S LEARN CHESS!
</h1>
  <h2>     THE BOARD</h2>
  <body>Each square on the board has a name or coordinate! Learning the square names is important for understand chess notation and to understand how the board is set up. The pieces are set up as such and white is always first to play. </body>

<h1>THE PIECES</h1>
<body>Each of the pieces move differently. When you are developing your pieces, they are typically placed in active squares to attack or defensive squares.</body>
<h2>     THE KING</h2>
<body>The King can move one space in any direction (up, down, diagonal, side). If the king is in check (in a position where he can be captured), then he must move to a different square. The king also cannot move to a square that puts it in check.</body>

<h2>     THE KNIGHTS</h2>

<h2>     THE PAWNS</h2
<body>On the first move, pawns can choose to move one or two spaces up. After the first move, they can only move one space up. Pawns cannot move backwards and can only capture diagonally. It is also important to note that pawns can only move diagonally when capturing. Once pawns get to the other end of the board, they can promote to become any other piece on the board (usually the queen).</body>

<h1>COMPONENTS OF THE GAME</h1>
  <body>The game is composed of three parts; the opening, middlegame, and endgame. There are four important aspects and basic strategies you should follow when playing the game:</body>
<h2>     BOARD GEOGRAPHY</h2
  <body>When starting the game, the center squares are important to gain control of. You want to place your pieces near or towards the center.</body>
<h2>     DEVELOPMENT</h2
  <body>The next step is to develop your pieces. You want to place your pieces in active squares, or locations where they will be useful in the future.</body>
<h2>     CASTLING</h2
  <body>Castling is when you switch your rook and your king. This is good for keeping your king out of the center and in a safer position.</body>
