LET'S LEARN CHESS!

  <h2>THE BOARD</h2>
  <blockquote>Each square on the board has a name or coordinate! Learning the square names is important for understand chess notation and to understand how the board is set up. The pieces are set up as such and white is always first to play. </blockquote>

<h1>THE PIECES</h1>
<blockquote>Each of the pieces move differently. When you are developing your pieces, they are typically placed in active squares to attack or defensive squares.</blockquote>
<h2>THE KING</h2>
  <blockquote>The King can move one space in any direction (up, down, diagonal, side). If the king is in check (in a position where he can be captured), then he must move to a different square. The king also cannot move to a square that puts it in check.</blockquote>

<h2>THE QUEEN</h2>
<blockquote>The Queen is the most powerful piece in chess. It can move any number of squares in all directions as long as she doesn't run into any pieces.</blockquote>
